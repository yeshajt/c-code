1. If strcmp returns 0, then both the strings are the same.
2. This is how I would rewrite the code in terms of if/else statements.
    int max;
    if (strcmp((g.level, "debug") == 0)
    {
        max = 9;
    }
    else
    {
        max = 1024;
    }
3. sscanf reads the command line arguments for specified inputs. It will return 2 instead of 1 if it read and converted both the digit and the character.
4. The coordinates of the grid are g.x and g.y
5. The function is show_cursor.
6. At the switch (line 159)
7. There is 1 blank in debug #1, 2 blanks in debug #2, and so on, until there are 9 blanks in debug #9.
